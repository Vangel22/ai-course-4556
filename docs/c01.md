# **1. LLM (Large Language Model)**

### **What it is**

An LLM is an artificial intelligence model trained on massive amounts of text so it can **understand and generate human-like language**.

### **How it works**

- It is built using neural networks (usually transformers).
- It learns patterns, grammar, facts, reasoning, and writing styles from billions of examples.
- When you type something, the LLM predicts the most likely next word or token—over and over—until a full answer is created.

### **Why it matters**

LLMs can:

- Answer questions
- Write code
- Summarize text
- Translate languages
- Assist in creative writing

They power tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot.

# **2. NLP (Natural Language Processing)**

### **What it is**

NLP is the field of AI focused on enabling computers to **understand, interpret, and generate human language**.

### **How it works**

NLP includes:

- **Tokenization** (splitting text into words/tokens)
- **Part-of-speech tagging** (identifying nouns, verbs, etc.)
- **Named Entity Recognition** (detecting names, places, dates)
- **Sentiment analysis** (positive/negative emotion)
- **Machine translation** (English → Macedonian, etc.)

### **Why it matters**

NLP is used in:

- Chatbots
- Voice assistants
- Search engines
- Spam detection
- Automatic subtitles

LLMs are part of NLP, but NLP existed long before LLMs.

# **3. Token Usage in AI**

### **What is a token?**

A **token** is a chunk of text that the model reads.
It can be:

- a word (“cat”),
- part of a word (“inter-”),
- punctuation (“.”)

Example:
“Hello, world!” → usually ~3–4 tokens.

### **How token usage works**

LLMs process text **one token at a time**.
Your input uses tokens, and the output also uses tokens.

For the model:

- More tokens = longer processing
- More tokens = higher cost (in paid APIs)
- More tokens = slower response

### **Why students should understand tokens**

- Helps them optimize AI prompts
- Helps in budget planning when using APIs
- Enables better system design for AI features

# **4. Digital Image Processing**

### **What it is**

Digital image processing involves using computers to **manipulate, enhance, and analyze images**.

### **How it works**

Key operations:

- **Filtering** (blur, sharpen, edge detection)
- **Noise removal**
- **Color correction**
- **Contrast improvement**
- **Resizing and cropping**
- **Histograms** (brightness distribution)

Mathematically, images are matrices of pixel values.
Algorithms modify these pixel values to produce a result.

### **Why it matters**

Used in:

- Instagram filters
- Photo enhancement
- Medical imaging (X-rays, MRIs)
- Satellite imagery
- OCR (reading text from images)

# **5. Computer Vision**

### **What it is**

Computer vision is the field of AI that enables computers to **“see” and understand images and videos** like humans do.

### **How it works**

Uses machine learning and deep learning models to identify:

- Objects (cars, people, cats…)
- Faces/expressions
- Movement
- Text in images
- Scene context

Common techniques:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- YOLO (object detection)
- ResNet, VGG (image classifiers)

### **Why it matters**

Used in:

- Autonomous driving
- Facial recognition
- Security cameras
- AR/VR
- Robotics
- Medical diagnostics

# **6. Autonomous Systems**

### **What they are**

Autonomous systems are machines that can operate **independently** without constant human control.

### **Examples**

- Self-driving cars
- Drones
- Delivery robots
- Industrial robots
- Smart irrigation systems
- Warehouse automation (Amazon robots)

### **How they work**

They combine:

1. **Sensing** (cameras, lidar, GPS, sensors)
2. **Perception** (computer vision + AI)
3. **Decision making** (path planning, obstacle avoidance)
4. **Control systems** (motors, actuators)

### **Why it matters**

They increase safety, precision, and efficiency in logistics, medicine, transport, and industry.

# **7. Prompts**

### **What is a prompt?**

A prompt is the **input** you give to an AI model to guide its output.
It can be:

- A question
- A command
- Context information
- An example
- A system instruction
- A combination of all of these

### **How prompts work**

The model tries to understand:

- your intent
- the task
- the format
- the tone
- the constraints

Then it generates an answer that fits those instructions.

### **Types of prompting**

- **Zero-shot prompting:** no examples (“Explain gravity.”)
- **Few-shot prompting:** give examples of what you want
- **Chain-of-thought:** instruct the model to reason step-by-step
- **Role prompting:** “You are a teacher…”
- **Structured prompting:** tables, bullet points, JSON

### **Why it matters**

Good prompts = better outputs.
AI literacy today requires knowing how to communicate effectively with LLMs.
